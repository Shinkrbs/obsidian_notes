# Atomic Commits

Tags: #Commits

Is a commit that contains a single, complete, and coherent (Clear and Logically connected) unit of work. It should be able to stand on its own, without depending on or affecting other commits. It should also have  a clear and descriptive message that summarizes the changes made.

## How to make atomic commits

1. Break down tasks into smaller and manageable tasks.
2. Use a branch for each task or feature.
3. Commit early and often. (Commit changes as soon as one subtask is finished. This will help save progress and track history. If problems arise, easy tracking and restoring of code can be done)
4. Write clear and concise commit messages. (Should follow conventions, one example is using the imperative mood)
5. Review and refine commits before pushing.
