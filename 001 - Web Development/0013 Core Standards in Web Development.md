## Request and Response Cycle

**Request:** Whenever a device or a client asks for a *resource* (that resource can be data, image, and HTML page, or an authentication token). It requires a connection to the internet in order to send that request.

**Response:** It is the *reply* to the request. It can contain the resource asked by the client. It could also contain a response saying the client isn't authorized to receive the resource.

**Main Job of a Server:** Receive a request from a client and return a response.
