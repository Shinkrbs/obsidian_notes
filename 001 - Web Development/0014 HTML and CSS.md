# Elements and Tags in HTML

Tags: #Elements #Tags 

**Elements** on an HTML page are pieces of content wrapped in opening and closing HTML tags.

**Opening Tags** tell the browser that this is the start of an HTML element. It is comprised of a keyword enclosed in angle brackets **<>**, one example is the paragraph tag.

**Closing Tags** tell the browser where an element ends. They are identical to the opening tags but contains a forward slash before the keyword, example of this is the closing tag for the paragraph tag.

A full paragraph element looks like this.
```html
<p> some text content </p>
```

An element can be considered as a container for content. The opening and closing tags tell the browser what content the element contains.
